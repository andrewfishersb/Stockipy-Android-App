## A final project for the Android segment at Epicodus by making a full fledged app, Started on 11/18//16

#### By **Andrew Fisher**

## Description
This app is a multi purpose app grocery and recipe app. The user will be able to save recipes or upload their own recipes. The user can put the recipes into a grocery list to make shopping at the store fast and easy. I would also like the user to keep stock of their fridge so they know what ingredients they do not have to buy.
